                        <ul class="text-left">
                            <li>Two of the founding members of Thin Lizzy, Phil Lynott and Brian Downey first met at
                                school in Dublin, Ireland.</li>
                            <li>Lynott joined a local band called '<em>The Black Eagles</em>', as vocalist in 1963, and
                                Downey was recruited as their
                                drummer in 1965</li>
                            <li>In 1967, Lynott was asked to join another band called '<em>Skid Row</em>' by guitarist
                                Brush Shiels,who also brought
                                Belfast guitarist
                                Gary Moore into the band 1968.</li>
                            <li> After a disappointing television appearance in June 1969, Shiels fired Lynott, he
                                however subsequently taught Lynott to play bass guitar.</li>
                            <li>Lynott then reunited with Downey and formed another band '<em>Orphanage</em>' with
                                Lynott as vocalist & guitarist whilst Downey was the bands drummer</li>

                    <h4 class="card-title">Early Years (1969–1972)</h4>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li>In December 1969 a guitarist named Eric Bell and organist named Eric Wrixon met by chance
                            in a pub where <em>Orphanage</em>
                            was performing.</li>
                        <li>Eric Bell introduced himself during a break and they agreed to form a band using Lynotts
                            compositions, thus making the initial line up a quartet.</li>
                        <li>In July 1970, the band released a single, "The Farmer"/"I Need You",it only sold 283 copies
                            and Wrixon left the
                            band before the single was released.</li>
                        <li> In the end of 1970 Thin Lizzy signed to Decca Records and travelled to London in January
                            1971 to record their
                            debut album titled 'Thin Lizzy'</li>
                        <li>The album sold moderately well but did not chart in the U.K despite airplay and support
                            from
                            influential DJs John
                            Peel and Kid Jensen</li>
                        <li> Despite poor sales of their debut album, Decca agreed to finance the band's second album
                            titled 'Shades of a Blue
                            Orphanage',it was released in March 1972</li>
                        <li>In late 1972, Decca released Thin Lizzy's version of a traditional Irish ballad, "Whiskey
                            in the Jar", as a
                            single.It topped the Irish chart, and reached no. 6 in the U.K </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="card-title">Mid-Life Years (1973-1975)</h4>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li>The band's next album, Vagabonds of the Western World, was released in September 1973
                            following strong airplay in
                            the U.K, but again failed to chart.</li>
                        <li>Eric Bell suddenly left the band on New Year's Eve 1973 in the middle of a tour and young
                            ex-Skid Row guitarist
                            Gary Moore was recruited to continue with tour</li>
                        <li>Moore stayed until April 1974 & Lynott expanded the line-up with two guitarists instead of
                            one,in order to complete
                            a scheduled tour of Germany in May 1974</li>
                        <li> After the initial unsuccessful recruits Lynott and Downey eventually settled on two
                            guitarists Brian Robertson and
                            Scott Gorham</li>
                        <li>In late 1974 the new line-up secured a record deal with Phonogram, and
                            released their forth album titled Nightlife.It was considered a dissapointment & failed to
                            chart</li>

                        <li>Thin Lizzy recorded their fifth album titled 'Fighting', which became the first Thin Lizzy

                        <li>In 1976 the band recorded the album 'Jailbreak', which proved to be their life changing and
                            breakthrough record
                            after the first five albums failed to chart.</li>
                        <li>Jailbreak featured the hit song "The Boys Are Back in Town" which reached no.8 in the U.K,
                            and no.12 in the US.It is
                            their most successful single to date</li>

                        <li>In early 1979 they recorded 'Black Rose: A Rock Legend in Paris',the album reached no. 2 in
                            the U.K despite the
